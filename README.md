# Simple Formik React App

## What Is It?
This is a simple form built using create-react-app and formik. It includes a field for a username and password. I included validation by requiring an input for both field, requiring a valid email address for the username, and at least 6 characters for the password. Once the user clicks `Submit`, the program alerts the user that the log in is successful. 

## What I Found Challenging
I found it slightly challenging to inclue email validation. I also made the Password validation very simple, only requiring 6 characters, because making it more complex would've taken much more time.

## What I Would Do Differently
Next time, I would require a more complicated password. I would also hide the password and include the list of requirements for a valid password. 

I enjoyed this project and look forward to working with Formik and forms more in the future.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
